# PSBooked

Powershell Module v0.1.0 for the PSBooked API

At the Moment all the Get-Booked* CmdLet should work properly.
I'm still working at the New-BookedReservation CmdLet, because it's relative complex

## Installation

### Requirements

- PSFramework (Min. Version 1.0.0)

### Deployments

Just use the Install.ps1. It pulls the Module from the Github Repository and Installs it in the Powershell Module Folder.
